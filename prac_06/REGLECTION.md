# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

In an effort to adapt to technical issues with LearnJCU, such as the inability to pause or navigate through lecture videos effectively, I now download the videos to watch offline. This not only resolves playback issues but also allows me to engage with the content more flexibly, such as rewinding for better understanding. Recognizing the format of our final exams, I've also started practicing coding by hand alongside using PyCharm. This dual approach helps cement my understanding and prepares me for written assessments.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I need to improve my time management significantly. Currently, I find myself completing practical tasks right before deadlines, which can be stressful and counterproductive. To address this, I plan to create a structured schedule that allocates specific times for studying and coding practice throughout the week. This will help ensure I engage with the material in a timely manner and reduce last-minute rushes.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I have been diligent in following along with the lecture content and ensuring that my practical work aligns closely with the provided sample outputs. This disciplined approach has been beneficial, and I will continue to prioritize alignment with course expectations while ensuring I fully understand the underlying concepts.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I've occasionally skipped over lecture videos, assuming familiarity with the topics. However, this has sometimes led to gaps in my understanding, especially when practical tasks or assignments present unexpected challenges. Going forward, I will commit to watching all lectures regardless of my initial confidence in the subject matter to ensure a comprehensive understanding and avoid missing crucial information.

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I would appreciate more feedback opportunities on practical assignments and projects. Regular, detailed critiques from instructors would help in identifying specific areas of improvement and in understanding how to apply theoretical knowledge more effectively. This could be particularly beneficial in enhancing our learning experience by allowing us to refine our skills continuously throughout the course.
