# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My initial estimates were often inaccurate due to a lack of understanding of the tasks' complexities and my own working pace.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

As I progressed through the subject, my estimates improved significantly. I developed a better grasp of how long tasks would take as I became more familiar with the coding processes and task requirements.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned the importance of understanding task complexity and recognizing my own productivity patterns. This helped me refine my estimates and plan more effectively.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Being reviewed taught me to be open to feedback and to use it constructively to refine my programming skills, particularly in areas like structuring programs and enhancing code logic.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Reviewing othersâ€™ code showed me the diverse approaches to coding problems and reinforced that there are multiple valid methods to achieve the same outcome. It broadened my understanding of programming and improved my problem-solving skills.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would incorporate more exercises that involve association and inheritance to provide students with deeper understanding and more hands-on experience with these concepts.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I excelled at applying theoretical knowledge to practical tasks, effectively using my understanding of programming concepts to solve problems and complete tasks efficiently.
