# CP1404 Practicals

This repository contains instructions and code for practicals for the subject CP1404 at James Cook University. I am Nang Kaung Shan Kham, currently studying Bachelor of IT.

Lessons I have learned about "clean code":

- Use CONSTANT VARIABLE for magic number
- Use SRP (Single Responsibility Principle) when creating functions
- Use # inline comments and """ doc string """ for commenting, also avoid noise comment
- Use set to remove redundancy
- Use try and except to avoid the program from crashing due to specific errors
