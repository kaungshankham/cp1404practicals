# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What percentage of the lecture videos have you watched so far?

I have completed viewing all lecture videos from weeks 1 through 3.

## What time, location and duration have you scheduled to watch lecture videos?

I typically watch the lecture videos at night, in the comfort of my home. The viewing sessions include breaks between videos, with each week's videos taking approximately 1 to 2 hours to watch.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I have maintained a consistent schedule for viewing lecture materials and completing assignments on time, which has greatly helped in understanding the core concepts. I plan to continue this disciplined approach to ensure I stay on track with the course material.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

To improve my learning efficiency, I need to enhance my note-taking strategy during lectures. Currently, my notes are somewhat disorganized, which occasionally leads to confusion when reviewing them. I plan to adopt a more structured note-taking method, like the Cornell note-taking system, to better capture and retain information.

## What are you currently doing poorly for practicals in this subject that you will change?

I've noticed that I sometimes rush through practical assignments without fully understanding the underlying principles. To rectify this, I will allocate more time to experiment with different Python features and review related materials before attempting the practical exercises.

## What are you doing really well for practicals in this subject?

I have been particularly effective at debugging code and optimizing Python scripts in practical assignments. My attention to detail and persistence in solving complex problems have been pivotal, and I intend to further enhance these skills through continuous practice and learning advanced techniques.
